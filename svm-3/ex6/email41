Grant Approvals

Resource Newsletter

Good morning 



Hope you have a great day today and an even greater week.



Just a quick reminder...



You may still be eligible to receive money for school.



The amount available is $5,815



And... if you're eligible, the funds can be directly deposited into your bank

account or you can receive the full amount on a personalized check.



Because these are granted funds, you do not have to pay the money back.



It is easy and quick to find out if you're eligible. Why not find out what schools

you can potentially attend with aid?
