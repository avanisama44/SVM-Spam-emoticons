Hey , I hope this message finds you in time.

I just wanted to let you know I've got some great news for you.

Money is being given out in your state for college

and you may be eligible [ http://clicks.aweber.com/y/ct/?l=Jvgt9&m=3VvT42Pc0waQQWA&b=aXVjsCzmY6laWpp2ANV_cw ] to receive some.

The amount you could receive is $5,815* and it's given to you in a check

or you can have it direct deposited.

You can use these funds for online courses to further your career and

help you earn more and enjoy life.

The best part is none of the funds have to be re-paid back.
