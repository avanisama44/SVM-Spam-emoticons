Phew.



I was wondering what happened to you.



Happy you are alive and okay.



Now for some good news...



I am here to remind you that you may be eligible to apply to receive grant

money for school.



The amount if awarded is $5,815 and it is given to you in a check or you can

have it direct deposited.



The best part of this is none of the funds have to be paid back.



It only takes about a minute to check it out and find out what schools you are

potentially eligible for.



Good Luck!
