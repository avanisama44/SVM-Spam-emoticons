Grant Approvals

Resource Newsletter

Hello again ,

Fact: today IS amazing.

Agree or disagree?

If you disagree, here’s some GREAT news that’ll change your mind.

You are eligible to receive grant money to attend schools in your

area.

After picking a college of your choice [ http://clicks.aweber.com/y/ct/?l=Jvgt9&m=3VgkVjwbrsaQQWA&b=Rp25jkVVT_4vZFDJqoEUZg ], the total amount of grant

funds made available to you is $5,815*.

This grant money comes in the form of a check or direct deposit,

which means you’ll have the freedom to spend it on whatever you

want.

What makes this amazing news is... you will NEVER be asked once

to pay the grant funds back!

Once accepted (which most are), you’ll be on track to improving

your future with a college education AND having the comfort and

security of getting paid to go to college!

Starting out is SUPER simple.
