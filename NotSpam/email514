Grant Approvals

Resource Newsletter

Good morning 

Hope you have a great day today and an even greater week.

Just a quick reminder...

You are still eligible to apply to receive money for school.

The amount available is $5,815*

And... if you’re eligible (most people are), you can be directly deposited into

your bank account or receive the full amount on a personalized check.

Because these are granted funds, you do not have to pay the money back.

It is easy and quick to find out if you’re eligible. Why not find out what schools

you can potentially attend with aid to?
