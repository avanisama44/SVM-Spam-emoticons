All of Liberty’s courses are taught from a Christian worldview by professors who regard

teaching as more than a job — it’s their calling. In addition to advanced degrees,

professors at Liberty have extensive experience in their fields and demonstrate

commitment to their faith and sincere concern for their students.



If you are interested in advancing your education in a Christian-focused environment

check out Liberty!



Sincerely,
