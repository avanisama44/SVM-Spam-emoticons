Hi, .

Don’t let this opportunity pass you by...

This is important (if you care about your future).

You are now eligible [ http://clicks.aweber.com/y/ct/?l=Jvgt9&m=3is7Zl7mAAaQQWA&b=RSxLzUNpgVNIPHtxTlWXFw ] to apply to receive a $5,815* in grant money.

This grant money will be sent as a check or a direct deposit (read:

not a voucher), so you use the funds just like cash.

Because it’s grant money... you will never be asked to pay the

money back!

$5,815* can be yours, but who knows what’ll happen next election.

The grant money program may go away at any time!

Go here and start before it goes away — it only takes a few

minutes!

Go Here Now [ http://clicks.aweber.com/y/ct/?l=Jvgt9&m=3is7Zl7mAAaQQWA&b=RSxLzUNpgVNIPHtxTlWXFw ]

Sincerely,

Ashlynn Shipp
