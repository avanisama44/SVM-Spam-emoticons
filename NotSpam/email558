Grant Approvals

Resource Newsletter

I spilled flour all over my kitchen this morning.

I hate when that happens!  (Not sure why I brought that up?)

 Anyways, I am here to remind you that you may be eligible to apply to receive grant money for school.



The amount is $5,815* and it would be given to you in a check or you can have it direct deposited.



The best part of this is none of the funds have to be paid back.



It only takes about a minute to check it out and find out what schools you are eligible for.
