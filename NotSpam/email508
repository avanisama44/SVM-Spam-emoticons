Crazy news...

Was at Target today and I saw the strangest thing happen.

A woman got arrested for stealing cookie dough.

She, um, tried to hide it in place that is... off limits.

But what happened was she got caught because the can of cookie dough

exploded from being there too long.

Anyway...

I am here to remind you that you are eligible to apply to receive grant money for school.

The amount is $5,815* and it is given to you in a check or you can have it direct

deposited.

The best part of this is none of the funds have to be paid back.

It only takes about a minute to check it out and find out what schools you are eligible for.
