Hi ,



What are your thoughts on school?



Let us look at the facts...



A recent study revealed that most high school graduates earn less than 60%

of what those with bachelor's degrees earn.*



In other words...



Going to college can be the difference between making $60,000 and $100,000.



Imagine what you could do with an extra $40,000 a year?



You could buy a new car.



Afford a nicer house.



And be way less stressed.



Sounds wonderful right?



It gets better.



Right now if eligible... you may be eligible to receive up to $5,815*  to make your college dreams happen!



What is even more amazing is that if you qualify you will never have to pay the money back.



Once it is sent to you in a check or direct deposit the money is yours to keep forever.



Since learning more about your financial aid eligibility only takes a minute, why

not spend a few moments to find out what schools you can potentially attend?

You never know until you try and you might be pleasantly surprised.
